      <h2>The Rise of AI in Mobile Development</h2>
      <p>AI integration in mobile apps is no longer a luxuryâ€”it's becoming essential for competitive apps. However, implementing AI features requires careful consideration of performance, cost, and user experience.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>API response times and caching strategies</li>
        <li>Cost management for AI API calls</li>
        <li>Fallback mechanisms for offline scenarios</li>
        <li>User privacy and data handling</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>VibeFast's AI Architecture</h3>
      <p>VibeFast includes pre-built AI components that handle these challenges:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Optimized API calls with intelligent caching</li>
        <li>Secure API key management</li>
        <li>Multiple AI provider support (OpenAI, Claude)</li>
        <li>Built-in error handling and retry logic</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Implementation Tips</h3>
      <p>When building AI features, always consider the user journey. Provide clear feedback during processing, implement progressive loading, and ensure graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable.</p>
